## Diatom Image Classification for Water Quality Monitoring

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for classifying diatom images, which can be used for water quality monitoring. The system will be trained on a dataset of diatom images and will learn to identify different species of diatoms, which can indicate the water quality.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an automated system for water quality monitoring using diatom image classification. This system can be used by water quality monitoring agencies, researchers, and environmental organizations to quickly and accurately identify diatom species and assess water quality.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

* Python 3.6 or later
* TensorFlow or PyTorch
* Jupyter Notebook
* Git
